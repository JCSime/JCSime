# Well, hello there!

## My name is John, I'm a Dominican-American FullStack Dev

# After 9 years of working in the service industry I finally decided to pursue my passion for programming. I was always tinkering as a kid and once I built my first PC I became addicted to computers. Even though I have great customer service skills I always felt limited in terms of my potential in those roles. After building up my software development skills I'm ready to enter the industry with excitement to want to go to work on Mondays!
